Let me start by saying that I love the effort you all have been putting into your memes lately. It's so inspiring to see the leaders of tomorrow procrasturbating their way to marginally above-average shitposts instead of studying for their exams. Really brings a tear to my eye.
  
That said, we all have a part to play in making sure actual questions take priority, especially during a crisis like the one we're facing. These questions can usually be somewhat dry or repetitive, but contributing can make a lot of difference to someone having a hard time, and is one of the primary purposes of the subreddit. Please consider it an act of community service.

At this time, we would like to ask that all members of the subreddit:

- Keep upvoting and contributing to Request for Assistance posts  
- Keep the shitposting somewhat contained to relevant posts
- Continue avoiding racially- or politically-charged language, harassment, bullying, doxxing, etc.  
  
If we can keep these things in mind, we would love to keep seeing your high-effort memes. Goodness knows we all need some comic relief. As a personal favour though, please make sure they're at least a 4/10 on the freshness scale.  
  
Stay safe out there.

1587507787,g5p3rb,Announcement,NEW: Post Flair,"Hi /r/geegees!

In the spirit of finally having our spirit crushed by the inevitable wheels of progress, we have started implementing some of the new features available in the reddit redesign. Over the past few days, you may have seen some colours change at the Theme level. Today's update brings **Post Flair.**  
  
Post Flair is, as the name suggests, flair that users or mods can assign to any user-submitted post on the subreddit. It helps to categorize content, and filter out posts you're not interested in seeing. Whether you're here for the questions, the discussions, or the memes, you can now use the [**Filter by Flair**](https://imgur.com/4OUgddA.png) option in the sidebar.

In this iteration, we are introducing the following flairs, which you can start using as of right now:

**[Announcements](https://imgur.com/htoZPO2.png)** (Mods only)  

**[Discussions](https://imgur.com/erTa02B.png)**  
  
**[Requests for Help](https://imgur.com/EgcqFE9.png)**  
  
and, of course... 
  
**[Shitposts](https://imgur.com/eVgpesX.png)**

We also made it so the flairs will change the post's appearance to a darker grey, to encourage people to use them. Give them a try if you want to bring more attention to your post!  
  
As always, feedback on this feature is welcome. Hope you're staying safe and healthy."

However, today I saw a first-year course listed as a compulsory under the 'My Academic Requirements' application, one not listed there before. This course is not listed on the course sequence, or anywhere under any of the tabs (Basic Skills, Compulsory, Optional, etc) when I search by My Requirements.

1587570348,g63hvr,Discussion,Government student aid finally announced!!!,"It's like Christmas all over again! Although this proposed measure hasn't come into effect yet and they are waiting to pass the legislation to implement it - this is fantastic news!

**EDIT: As far as I understand, this is for everyone who is NOT eligible for CERB** 

Brief summary for you all:

* Eligible students to **receive $1,250 a month** from May to August (for those who are caretakers or have disability, this amount will go up to $1,750 per month)
* **Eligibility criteria:** is currently a postsecondary student, going into PSE in September (grade 12 graduates), OR recent PSE graduates in December 2019
* This also includes students who currently have a job, but who only earn up to $1,000 a month
* Period covered will be **retroactive to May 1** and payments to be delivered through CRA
* For student **researchers and graduate students**: government is investing over **$291 million** **to extend scholarships, fellowships, and grants** (extended by 3 or 4 months) to allow these students to continue their work
* Students who are volunteering in the fight against COVID-19 may be eligible for the **Canada Student Service Grant,** which provides up to $1,000 ‚Äì $5,000 (depending on the hours spent volunteering),

Gov to also double student grants for the 2020-2021 school year

Hopefully once passed, this can help students cover some of those expenses and take off a little bit of the burden.

Why not try to get the freshman experience even if it is far apart? Why don't we try to communicate with each other, so that we don't feel alone? I know I am not going to be alone, but if I don't have someone to talk to about the class or how it is going, I am gonna feel alone. And, I am sure a lot of upcoming freshmen are feeling the same as me. So, let's try to get the ""classic"" freshman experience even if it is far apart.

1587626951,g6icah,Discussion,"My opinion on the ""Alex"" situation","I am a student in that class and here is my opinion.

**To the people defending Alex by saying he is simply preventing cheating**: There is nothing wrong with preventing cheating. Cheating is clearly illegal and as a TA it is part of his responsibility to disallow such acts. But the issue here is not his end-goal, but rather the way he has approached this situation. It could be argued that trying to obtain people's IP is already pushing it, but in addition, sending out emails with comments such as ""Have fun explaining this to the ethics committee"", ""I will make sure the hammer drops"" and ""as my dog is my witness"".. is just extra and disgusting. Comments like these don't help anyone especially at a university with multiple suicides in a year. If someone has cheated, writing comments like that literally does nothing for the situation. There is no justifying his method of communication.

**To the person that sent the comment to the TA and the dean:** I hope by now you realize what you have done. Let us put aside the fact that you are not even in the class, as one could say you were just trying to defend your fellow UOttawa students. The issue is you wrote a page full of empty words with no meaning and actual arguments. You write that the TA has issues in his pride and ""does not belong in this university"". You have simply stooped to Alex's level and made the situation worse for everyone. If you felt so eager to write an email, you could have presented your arguments in a respectful manner and clearly state why you disagree with what has happened. What did you think was going to happen? You dug a 10 feet deep hole and buried everyone involved with 10 feet of crap.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that Alex was probably the type of guy that wrote emails like this to TA's during his undergraduate years and the student who wrote that email is probably going to be a TA writing emails like that to students. You are both different sides of the same coin."

1587687379,g6y8o8,9000 IQ,What to do with your student aid money? Very simple.,"Ok everyone, so based on this [uOttawa data](https://www.uottawa.ca/institutional-research-planning/resources/facts-figures/cudo/2016-section-a), we have approximately 40,000 domestic students on campus. 

Lets assume about 90% of uottawa students make less than 5000$/year, which I think is reasonable considering that most of us have expenses and other things. These students are ineligible to receive student aid, and we'll forget CERB for now. 

So approximately 36,000 of us are receiving 1,250$/month, from May - August: 4 months. 

36,000 x 1,250 x 4 = $180 million. 

What can we do with 180,000,000? Very simple - We could buy 180 million McChickens. 

What can we do with 180 million Mcchickens? Very simple - How much space does a Mcchicken take up? Based on [this image](https://www.mcdonalds.com/is/image/content/dam/usa/nfl/nutrition/items/hero/desktop/t-mcdonalds-McChicken.jpg) I'd say around 10x10x6cm inches which is about 0.0006 cubic meters. 

Why is this important? Very simple - 180,000,000 x 0.0006 = 108,000 cubic meters. 

What could we do with 108,000 cubic meters of McChickens? Very simple  - based on the info in [this document](https://www.uottawa.ca/facilities/sites/www.uottawa.ca.facilities/files/building_list_june_2019.pdf), we could fill every usable square inch of every residence building; STEM; CRX; UCU; FSS and approximately 10 LRT cars (based on [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20170826080030/http://www.alstom.com/Global/Transport/Resources/Documents/brochure2014/Citadis%20Spirit%20-%20Brochure%20-%20EN.pdf?epslanguage=en-GB)).

1587749823,g7cqe7,Request for Help,(Please help) Are my grades enough to get me into UofOttawa computer science?,"(Please help) Are my grades enough to get me into Ryerson computer science?

Okay, I urgently need some advice on this and I would be truly grateful if anyone could put my mind at ease because I've been stressing over this for the past few weeks. Let me describe my situation.

I'm in 12th grade right now in the UK, pursuing my A Levels. My exams are supposed to take place in October but with everything going on I'm almost certain it's going to get canceled, but I'm progressing my studies as if the exams will take place.

I had three AS level subjects (that's 11th grade, for those unfamiliar with the British academic system). They were Mathematics (including Statistics as a separate syllabus), Physics, and Business. I had achieved 92% in Mathematics, 91% in Physics and 85% in Business. Mathematics is my favorite subject and I've never found myself struggling with it, nor with Statistics.

The plan was obviously to continue with these three subjects for my A2 level (12th grade). I have breezed through the entire Mathematics syllabus with ease, and finished the Business syllabus as well, although there is work to be done there. 

However, I am finding 12th grade Physics downright dreadful. The contents of the syllabus are extremely complex and I am simply failing to achieve even a basic understanding of the topics. It goes without saying that getting an excellent score will require a thorough understanding of the whole syllabus and going through numerous practice papers. I don't see myself getting to a point like that under any circumstances, because I have been trying for months to get good at A2 Physics but I've come to realize that this is simply beyond my intellectual aptitude. 

I am seriously considering dropping A2 Physics, and just continuing with Mathematics and Business for my A2 level. It's worth noting here that Mathematics includes a separate Statistics syllabus.

Now my question is, will my final subjects be enough for me to get into the computer science program at Ryerson University? In effect, I would be having three AS level (11th grade) subjects, and two A2 level (12th grade) subjects. It would be a very safe assumption to make that I am going to achieve above 90% in both A2 Mathematics and Business.

Any and all opinions and insight will be greatly appreciated."

1587924718,g8j8dr,Discussion,Do graduate schools care about the # of courses you take in a semester?,"I was talking to someone, and he suggested that I not take summer courses if I'm thinking about applying to competitive graduate programs. He said the selection committee will see that you shifted courses to the summer, and they will thus give priority to students who have taken the full course load during the semester.  The rationale is that students who take the full course load during the semester are better able to handle stress and pressure than students who shift some of their courseload to the summer. 

He is not on a selection committee, but he seemed quite certain (he graduated from a competitive graduate program). I'm unsure.

I'm a 4th-year (going to 5th) Software Engineering student here and I'm considering applying for a Master's in Computer Science (Coursework with Project, NOT Thesis). I just wanted to know if anyone else has gone through the admission process and can give me some tips or things to start doing to help improve my chances.  
As it stands, my GPA is at a 6.27, but I can get it above 7 by the time I graduate (May 2021) as I'm still going to take about 12 or so courses (some repeated to boost my GPA). I'm planning on applying for admission for the Winter 2022 semester so I've got roughly a year before I have to submit my application.  
Outside of trying to build some rapport with professors like Carlisle Adams (I'm considering specialising in Cybersecurity), what other things can I do to boost my admission chances? I've emailed the admission's office and they said they can't go in-depth about how they choose their candidates (for obvious reasons).

I need to seek out help from the public and see if anyone has ever experienced something like this. I am currently a 3rd year nursing student at uOttawa who had a shitty clinical teacher. She put me on a learning contract on my last week of clinical and gave me an NS in the course. The nursing course sequence is set up for you to fail where if you receive a NS grade, you cant continue with your studies until you complete the course again during the same semester next year. So failing this course in jan 2020, I won't be able to complete it until Jan 2021, delaying my graduation by a year. With covid-19, there is a rotation this summer but the school isn't letting me take it. I appealed the grade and it came back unsuccessful and want to appeal to the Senate Committee to further my appeal, but Im not sure what else I can say to have them accept it and allow to continue with my studies in a timely manner.

We got an email about a week ago from the prof saying that lectures would be held on Zoom from 9 to 11:50am twice a week. This is different from the class times stated during enrollment. I planned to drop the course because I have a job which would conflict with this new schedule, but he sent another email shortly after (some other students complained I think) saying that lectures would be uploaded to Brightspace after the meetings for those with conflicting schedules.

Today we got the syllabus for the course which says ""due to technical limitations, there is no guarantee that recordings of each lecture will be available."" So those with conflicting schedules might miss course content with no way to make up for it.

I really don't believe there are any actual technical limitations that can't be worked around, Zoom has cloud and local recording and there are also third party screen/audio recorders that can be used as a back up. I suspect this is just a way to make  students show up to the Zoom meetings.

Here is the link: [https://uottawa.saea-tlss.ca/en/transition-to-remote-teaching/proctoring-software](https://uottawa.saea-tlss.ca/en/transition-to-remote-teaching/proctoring-software)

I wanted to iterate some points that I had not already made.

As indicated by the product owner here:  [https://web.respondus.com/tou-monitor-student/](https://web.respondus.com/tou-monitor-student/) ""Respondus Monitor will save all recordings of students for a period of one (1) year"" and "" Institutions have the ability to retain the data for up to an additional four (4) years"". On the same page, its also says ""Respondus does not guarantee removal of all traces of any information or data (including recordings) from the Respondus Monitor Services after deletion.""

Finally, relating to some of the comments that other people made on the last post, its says "" Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, and Respondus does not warrant the security of any information collected using its services. By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to use Respondus Monitor at your own risk, and agree that Respondus shall not be liable if a security breach occurs, if the site malfunctions, or if information is misused or mismanaged in any way to your detriment or the detriment of a student or third party, whether by Respondus, your institution, or an unauthorized third party.""

I would still assume that it is ultimately up to the prof if they want to use a tool like this or not, but it seems like the university is officially recognizing it."

1598576740,ihxlz4,Discussion,Unpopular opinion: I don't support a mandatory anti-racism course for all undergrads,"I ask that you read through what I say before you downvote me. 

[UOSU + other uOttawa student unions announced on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UOSU.SEUO/posts/1087713618293015) that they are supporting a mandatory anti-racism course. i.e. both history and engineering majors will have to take the course. I am all for an anti-racism course being offered, but I think that making such a course mandatory is improper. It will serve as a detriment to students who use their electives to explore their own areas of interest. 

More importantly, I do not believe that making such a course mandatory will promote diverse opinions and perspectives, as it purports to. It is almost certain that if a course like this comes into existence, it will stretch beyond simple anti-racism purview. I do not think I am wrong in predicting that it will aggressively promote the controversial agenda of the dominant political group on university campuses. It will counteract one of the fundamental tenets of all universities: to challenge our notions of the world, and foster a platform for opinions from all parts of society. 

As a student I am afraid to speak openly on campus about my political beliefs. To be clear, I condemn all racism and discrimination, I am 100% fine with gay and transgender people, and I believe that we must take strong action on global warming. I do not agree with the idea of safe spaces and microaggressions. I don't think that the number of intersections you have should factor into how valid your opinion is, and I believe that capitalism and its hierarchies are necessary for the proper functioning of society. I think these are all reasonable opinions, and they should not be silenced or suppressed, but discussed and considered. By forcing students to take the kind of anti-racism course that further strengthens these ideals and suffocates alternate perspectives we will be doing the university and its student body a disservice.   

I am kind of expecting this post to be removed or downvoted to oblivion, but I am willing to listen to others and discuss these thoughts further. 

TLDR: I disagree because engineers shouldn't need to take this kind of course, and it will likely suffocate opinions which counter the dominant campus viewpoint."

It‚Äôs also my heaviest class bc I didn‚Äôt take grade 12 physics, and I feel like it‚Äôs taking time away from my other classes, so if I were to drop one it would be that.

I had a healthcare issue which was not serious but was time-sensitive, so I made an account and started a new consultation. I answered a few questions with an AI chatbot thing to select the reason I was contacting them and typed out a brief description of why I was there. About a minute after sending it, I was told that it had been reviewed and they suggested a virtual consultation. This was at 2:10, and the next available consultation was at 2:20. I booked it and filled out some other information about my family doctor, my address, my health care number, my pharmacy, etc. At 2:19, I got a message from the nurse assigned to me that she was reviewing my information, and at 2:23 she asked if she could video call me. I answered the call and she went over my issue and answered my questions for a few minutes (I think the call was around 6-8 minutes total), we hung up, and a few minutes later she sent me a quick review of all the information and follow-up we discussed during the call. 

Overall, I was really impressed with how quickly and smoothly everything went, and it seems like a really good option for people with simple medical questions or prescription renewals (they said they can't renew prescriptions for benzos, narcotics, cannabis, testosterone, or stimulants, though)."

Some of you already have that pit in your stomach of shitty exams and seeing your entire future university career flash before your eyes.

I want to reassure every last one of you that its going to be alright. In one way or another you will make it out of this. This is the first, and probably the most important thing. First year is difficult, it is a foreign experience to many of you, and for many it might be your first foray into how ""adults"" work. And this year, on top of everything else, its isolating, its impersonal, and its disorienting. 

And that's completely alright. I want to make that clear. It is okay to feel lost right now. Don't be ashamed that ""you're just not getting it"". The rest of us, we see your plight, we understand what you're going through. Hell, most of us upper years are grappling with similar struggles, both personally and academically. 

Some of you might simply need to adjust your study habits. Others might require more drastic changes in the way you approach the material and the courses. A few of you might elect to take some time off, think about things, and work on your life as a whole. All of this is fine. You are not defined by your academic merit. There is more to you than the student. You're a person, and as a person you should do what you feel is right.

I'm not suggesting to give up. I'm not suggesting you drop out today and run for the hills. I'm suggesting that its important to ground yourself, and to realize the big picture. I'm suggesting that you take advantage of the plethora of communities we have to see if you can get back that social atmosphere. From school runs clubs to facebook group chats, there's something for everyone. Apparently there are a ton of good Discord servers out there.

I want to note one thing. Don't be afraid to reach out to people behind the screens. Strike up a conversation, try your luck. Chances are the other person is as lonely as you are. We can rebuild, together. In person that's how we did it anyways.

At the end of the day, regardless of how your midterms go, regardless of everything else, remember the big picture. Its ok to take care of yourself. 

And on a final note, I don't mean to speak for all upper years, but I'm sure my peers would agree. We want to help you guys. We want to see you succeed. So through any means don't be scared to approach any of us (yes you can DM me). We'll make it through this together."
1602907120,jcoh3x,Discussion,In regards to the cheating that has happened in ITI and recently BIO,"So far I have only heard of 2 classes that caught cheating and so I feel like I should share my opinions and a reminder that it's just an opinion and before I start I'll say that cheating is bad and shouldn't be done. First is obvious and that is you shouldn't cheat and I know a random person on the internet telling someone not to cheat is gonna have nothing done but just hear me out. Yes we know that some of the courses that you cheat on may not have value for you in the future but regardless there is a reason why this course is in place and that is to strengthen you up for OTHER courses and not for the future, also you should always remember that uni does not determine your worth or your thinking ability in the future and believe it or not but you will eventually recover from bad results and I know each one of you can. Second thing that I'll say is a little controversial but hear me out, my hs teacher told me this before I graduated and she said ""If you're gonna cheat then cheat properly and don't let anyone catch you"" at the end of the day profs dont care and if you're gonna do something then do it properly. I am in no way encouraging cheating but all I'm saying is that if you're gonna do something then atleast do it the right way. Remember that it is your future that you are building meaning your actions and attitudes towards tests will determine you not whether you get an A+ on a test or an F on a test so you decide and take steps towards your future. Study and remember that you giving your best is what matters. That's it have a good one!!!!!"

1603056460,jdoplz,Discussion,Responsible academic freedom vs privilege,"I'm Jeremy Kerr, and I am the Chair of the Department of Biology at University of Ottawa. 

Recently, there was an incident in a lecture course in a different Faculty that led to the use of the N-word in the lecture. A follow-up apology from the instigator did not meet expectations and did not demonstrate awareness or expertise. Now a letter has been published by a small group of professors that tried to make the case for enabling this word to be used on the grounds of academic freedom. I say the letter very late last night and have been working on the issue continuously since.

I condemn this letter unequivocally. I object utterly to an incident where white professors are attempting to explain to people of colour or allies when it is acceptable to them to be subjected to this kind of language. 

Under some circumstances, and with consent, there \*may\* be legitimate ways to discuss the use of this word in controlled, safe settings. That was an intelligent discussion that the community could have begun with, but this did not happen. I suspect that this is what the professors wished to suggest in their letter, but my reading of that letter led me to conclude something else: instead of leading with kindness, that letter leads with privilege and entitlement.

I support the responsible use of academic freedom. It is vital. However, academic freedom is not identical to freedom of speech, nor does academic freedom grant anyone carte blanche to say whatever they want whenever they wish. This is a perversion of the concept of academic freedom. Academic freedom is intended to protect controversial scholarship. The emphasis is on ""scholarship"". It is not there to protect dilletantes and academic freedom should never license hate speech. Moreover, it is a privilege granted ultimately by society and the abuse of academic freedom arguments, which is very common, devalues it and makes it less likely that society will extend the privilege. 

I am appalled at this incident. We will continue and expand our anti-racism work, which we began long ago and that is predicated on engaging our \*entire\* community respectfully. Diversity is a fact, and inclusion is a choice. We will choose inclusion.

Whatever else, defending one principle, like academic freedom, does not imply we must therefore abandon others, like treating members of this community with respect. Kindness needs to be factored into our thinking. To the extent that this simple truth is being lost in the outrage that predictably followed this foolish letter from professors, then I beg that members of the university community consider whether they have forgotten that kindness and respect are the way to begin dialog, not an afterthought to be added optionally at the end."

1603096893,jdy1tr,Discussion,‚ÄúMessage concerning an incident at the Faculty of Arts‚Äù - Message from the President,"The following email was sent out to students and staff:

&gt; The following is a statement that President and Vice-Chancellor Jacques Fr√©mont will deliver at the University of Ottawa‚Äôs Senate meeting on Monday, October 19. 
Dear members of the uOttawa community,
 
You have perhaps heard about a recent incident at the Faculty of Arts wherein a part-time professor used the ‚Äún-word‚Äù during a class. A student reacted after class in an email to the professor. The latter subsequently apologized, stating that she was unaware that her use of the n-word was unacceptable, and invited her students to discuss the issue in their next class together.
 
For at least a year and a half now, uOttawa has experienced racist and racially motivated incidents. We have held many Town Halls at which difficult conversations have been had about the various ways racism is expressed on our campus. We are, like many other universities, taking stock of the systemic dimensions of racism and we have committed to making meaningful changes to address these issues.
 
One dynamic raised regularly in our conversations has been that of the aggressions and micro-aggressions to which members of uOttawa‚Äôs Black and racialized communities are subjected. What might appear trivial to a member of the majority may be perceived as profoundly offensive to members of minority communities. Members of dominant groups simply have no legitimacy to decide what constitutes a micro-aggression.
  
It is in this context that the recent incident at the Faculty of Arts occurred, an incident that many have attempted to characterize as a simple issue of academic freedom or of freedom of expression. It is, however, more complicated than that since many members of our community judge that their right to dignity has been affected. Thus, two principles appear to be in conflict and to require reconciliation. It was in pursuit of just such a resolution that the leadership of the Faculty of Arts proactively met with students and established a new section of the course in question to serve students who did not wish to continue their classes with their original professor. This was a necessary step to accommodate and respect the rights of all.
 
Some have pointed out that the professor in question wished to discuss her use of the n-word in a subsequent class. This is an expression of her academic freedom and she surely has the right do so. However, it should come as no surprise if many Black and racialized students are unwilling to join her in this discussion, especially in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, many will not want to have to argue yet again that their right to dignity should be respected. When this incident occurred, the professor could have chosen not to use the full n-word. Yet she did and is now facing the consequences.
  
Freedom of expression and academic freedom are essential to the functioning of any university. We must fight to ensure that these freedoms remain ubiquitous in our daily lives. Personally, I can assure you that I regularly fight to protect the freedom of expression of my colleagues in response to the steady stream of people writing to my office concerning things that have been written or said and demanding that their author be sanctioned. Every day difficult conversations are held on our campus and in our classes, on all sort of issues. Critical thinking depends on academic freedom.
 
And yet, contrary to so much of what has been written in recent days, the right to freedom of expression and the right to dignity are not contradictory principles, but complementary. They must co-exist with one another. This is the task we have been given.
  
Throughout these recent days the professor in question has remained an employee of uOttawa. During the several days when she did not teach the university organized a coordinated return for her to class with her cooperation. She is free to continue her teaching (which she returned to last Friday) while enjoying her full academic freedom.

I have a bunch of questions and I really hope someone here knows the answers. I emailed my university a couple of days ago and still waiting for their response but they tend to answer half of what I inquire about. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) When they ask for proof of canadian status, can i submit a picture of my passport or must it be in a different format and a different document? 

2) If I was a student at algonquin college in the past and i'm currently a student at uOttawa, do i still need to send my highschool transcripts through OUAC to the universities I'm applying to? 

3) Whats the difference in sending my transcripts now or waiting until the end of the term or the end of the year? Will they review my file later on if my transcripts were sent at the end of the term/year instead of immediately? 

Do I need a language proficiency test if I'm a canadian and a native english speaker? 

In certain sections where they ask for the date that i'll receive my degree on, it wont allow me to input a date past 2021-12. What do I type there? Todays date? 2021-12?

Would I be able to send my transcripts a second time if the first time i sent them ""immediately"" but the second time they were sent ""after the term is finished""?"

Je fais partie de cette marge. Je suis noir, qu√©b√©cois et francophone et les tentatives de censure et appels √† jouer √† la police morale dans un context aussi banal m'inqui√®te. J'ai exprim√© sur Twitter, en particulier, mon d√©dain pour le traitement auquel la professeure Lieutenant-Duval a √©t√© subject√© ainsi que les signataires de l'inf√¢me lettre co-sign√©e par une trentaine de professeurs. Mes commentaires ont √©t√© accueillis avec hargne, injures et attaques contre ma personalit√©. On m'a trait√© de raciste, de l√¢che, de vendu, de manipul√©, de misogyne (?) et j'en passe. Ce qui me plait le plus, c'est me faire donner la le√ßon, avec un ton moralisateur, par des blancs sur comment traiter les noirs.

Je trouve cela particuli√®rement ironique que certains individus, d√©fenseurs du soi-disant ""respect"", aient soulign√© que [les signataires de cette lettre sont majoritairement francophone](https://twitter.com/ihachey/status/1317803962888749057/photo/1). Ce sous-entendu, posons-nous la question, n'est-il pas l'incarnation exacte de ce √† quoi ces m√™me gens s'opposent? Les qu√©b√©cois sont culturellement diff√©rents aux anglophones, et la libert√© acad√©mique et les consid√©rations du contexte apparaissent comme un aspect sur lequel nous somme culturellement diff√©rent. 

Je ne suis pas raciste, et ne per√ßoit pas de racisme dans le d√©nonciation de la censure, nous, qu√©b√©cois, sommes diff√©rents. L'amplitude de la controverse par rapport √† l'emploi neutre de mots charg√©s au Qu√©bec n'est pas la m√™me. Elle ne provoque pas la m√™me indignation au Qu√©bec. Pour preuve: [ici](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsTFAYz58ZE), [ici](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqHZPSy3PuA), [ici](https://twitter.com/RadioCanadaInfo/status/1318607420889989123), [ici (Grand angle sur l'actualit√©)](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/premiere/emissions/midi-info/episodes/487977/rattrapage-du-lundi-19-octobre-2020/10) et [ici](https://twitter.com/RadioCanadaInfo/status/1318555827012251648). Je vais arr√™ter, sinon, je serai encore ici demain matin. 

Mon argument est que dans la culture qu√©b√©coise, une immense proportion de la population croit que l'universit√© est un lieu de transmission du savoir o√π la censure n'a pas sa place, m√™me si elle blesse. Pas de place dans les universit√©s pour l'obscurantisme; elle est ""fiduciaire de la transmission du savoir.""

Je vous en implore, ne combattez pas une injustice per√ßue par plus d'injustice. Cela d√©cr√©dibilise le mouvement. Dans tout cela, il y a de la place pour le respect d'autres points de vue et le respect des diff√©rences culturelles."

1603234061,jf0l2r,Discussion,My take Recent incident on the N-word,"I think people are overly sensitive this time, as racism should be determined with context and intent, not just by the use of a word choice. For the professor specifically, it might be a bad word choice. Since she teaches history, then why is it that certain part of history should be censored because it's bad? If so, how should we know how bad the history should be? Do we just use our imagination or rely some sort of "" ministry of truth"" to tell us? Consider things without context is bad, I believe, as it is a case against scientific process where it becomes subjective to thoughts and opinions instead of historical references.


If you censor the word entirely, then what's the difference it makes to removing ""to kill a mocking bird"" from education system because it's racist and makes people uncomfortable? It is meant to teach people how gruesome racism is in the past, not that it is teaching people how to be racist."

1603340927,jfswzz,Discussion,An appeal for calm and reflection from President Jacques Fr√©mont,"&gt; Dear students, 
 
&gt; Many things have been written and said over the past few days concerning the use of the n-word by one of our professors in the Faculty of Arts. I made a public statement to emphasize that academic freedom is not incompatible with the right to be treated with dignity. In doing so, I may not have sufficiently underscored the impact on our students of a word whose semantic, historical and connotative burden is so overwhelming as to make it one of the most offensive and least acceptable words in the English language today.
 
&gt; Simply put, the University of Ottawa condemns racism in all its forms, full stop.
 
&gt; For reasons of confidentiality, I am not at liberty to discuss the details of the incident that led to the University‚Äôs intervention in relation to the professor whose actions lie at the heart of the recent controversy. However, I can stipulate that the Dean of Arts intervened at the request of the professor and of students to attempt to resolve tensions that were undermining the teaching and learning environment. Let me reassure you that the decision to withdraw her temporarily from the classroom long enough to look into the situation was not taken arbitrarily, and that her academic freedom was at no point threatened. This response was clearly in line with the collective bargaining agreement that governs the working conditions of part-time faculty members at uOttawa. Both the professor and her union took part in the process that led to her returning to her duties; she remained an employee of uOttawa throughout this process.
 
&gt; We are currently witnessing a disagreement between two diametrically opposed camps attacking each other through various media channels. In such a hostile and disrespectful environment, little progress can be made. The more tension we have around these social issues, the more radicalized and polarized the discourse becomes and the more difficult it is to find a viable way forward.
 
&gt; Our community deserves better, and I am pleased to note that its members have in recent days and despite divergent positions, nevertheless converged on the essential: an open university where the fundamental missions are articulated in full respect for the academic freedom and dignity of each of its members and where all deserve to be treated with dignity and not to be marginalized. There is a consensus on this, and it is to be welcomed.
 
&gt; Reflection and calm are required now. I encourage all those who wish to be heard to speak respectfully so as not to further enflame tensions. We all agree that contempt, defamation and disrespectful language are not appropriate and do not enrich the debate. Words like these do not lead to the productive discussions that we hope to have in the future. Make no mistake, my wish is that this debate can take place.
 
&gt; Questions pertaining to academic freedom and freedom of expression are fundamental. Equally profound are questions concerning the right to be treated with dignity. Such principles must be treated with care, even in an academic milieu. Every professor has a duty to establish a healthy and respectful learning environment. Every professor must also moderate discussion that may at times be difficult in such a way as to ensure that the rights of students are never infringed upon. I know that this is a concern for every one of our professors.
 
&gt; In conclusion, please let me reiterate my profound commitment ‚Äì and that of the University of Ottawa ‚Äì to the promotion of critical discourse on campus. While the conversations are often arduous, they are necessary. And we have an obligation to ensure that our dialogue remains respectful and productive. We owe it to our students; we owe it to ourselves as a community and we owe it to society. We can and must do better.

1603385145,jg3ats,Request for Help,Carleton to UOttawa Nursing Transfer,"Okay so this is going to be relatively long so that you guys can understand my situation. Any insight is appreciated! 

So I graduated hs with I think a low-mid 80s average (I can‚Äôt remember the exact number) in 2019, then went to Carleton that fall for sociology. I‚Äôve always been interested in medicine but I convinced myself that I was too stupid to succeed. I didn‚Äôt apply myself in hs, and the highest science I took was 11U Bio. 

I did okay in first year...I have I think a high B average, but I obviously could‚Äôve done a lot better. I did not enjoy my program and was uninterested. This past summer I started filling my hs science prereqs to either switch to bio at Carleton or transfer to nursing at uOttawa. I‚Äôm not overly interested in other schools for nursing as it‚Äôs much cheaper to live at home :) 

Obviously I picked nursing, hence the title of this post, and I‚Äôm honestly very excited but a bit nervous that I won‚Äôt get in. Currently I‚Äôm taking 4U chem, and I currently have a midterm grade of 88%. After I will take 3M Functions (I only took college math in grade 11 cause I told myself I was dumb yet got a high 80 in the course) and then 4U Bio. I can only do these courses one at a time unfortunately. I will be applying in February for all 3 BScN programs at uOttawa once I‚Äôve finished the prereqs. The Algonquin woodroffe campus is my top choice because it‚Äôs a very quick commute for me. Again, I‚Äôm applying to all 3 to give myself the best possible chance of admission. I have no idea what I‚Äôll do if I don‚Äôt get in. 

Also wanted to add that I am technically a second year Carleton student, but I HAVE NOT done any courses since first year because I knew I wanted to switch to nursing. 

My biggest concern is that UO will look at my first year CU grades more than my hs grades and that will result in me not being accepted. Because I‚Äôm doing each of the 3 hs prereqs one at a time, I expect to get mid to high 80s in all, fingers crossed. 

Again any input is welcomed...try not to crush my spirit too much though ;) but again I appreciate any experiences/input you have. Thanks!!"

You have access to telehealthcare with DIALOGUE. Its paid for by the ssuo fees. You can speak with a nurse practicionner or doctor. They also offer counselling. https://www.dialogue.co/en/
I have used this for quick health stuff like refilling prescriptions or minor things like rashes. It is super easy, you fill out the form and video chat with a nurse practitioners on the same day, usually within 10 mins.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Making a decision, such as picking a job or dropping a class, talking through pros and cons.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†I had a bad interaction with someone at work or in my friend group. I feel sad about it, I want to talk or figure out why it affects me so much or how to react next time.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†I need strategies to manage my time this week, I have too much to do and don‚Äôt know where to start.

Just plug your headphones in, pick a quiet spot or go for a walk outside and dial.

Talking to a counsellor can help. Its anonymous, you will probably only have to wait 5-10 mins to speak with someone, its free and it can make you feel a million times better. You just have to dial the phone.
Noone at the university will know, its totally confidential. 

If you haven‚Äôt talked to a counsellor before, I think it can be intimidating, but very valuable.
They might ask you for an emergency contact, and they will only break confidentiality if they get a court order, or you tell them you are actively suicidal or homicidal, then they will call 911."

1603513801,jh2rox,Discussion,I am Shell Shocked,"I am stunned at how seriously this university takes accusations of violation of academic professorship by instructors. 

I am surprised that no group exists here that leaks exams. 

Apparently, professors do not bribe their way to the top here. The internal controls here are amazing. 

Intimidation by professors is not tolerated at all. Threatening behavior by professors to students, including verbal abuse is strictly forbidden. 

The deans and president take complaints seriously. 

Professor's don't copy and paste responses to students, they actually respond to the students. 

Deceptive tactics from professors is not tolerated here. 

But most of all, complaints by students against professors are taken seriously here. 

Absolutely stunning. 

I cannot believe it.

I will say I am from another university in Canada and I now realize that what I experienced there was not normal. 

You have an amazing university UOttawa students. Be proud of it."

1603559506,jhcl9y,Discussion,insecure,"Someone in first year told me I look intimidating. I think it‚Äôs because of my height (5‚Äù10 F). Also, I‚Äôm what some people would call attractive. I say this in the least arrogant and conceited way possible but it‚Äôs an unavoidable fact. I feel like it‚Äôs the only thing people think I have going for me, and it‚Äôs a useless and worthless trait that has nothing to with me..

inside , I‚Äôm the most insecure person I know. 

I‚Äôm extremely lonely (due to social anxiety and inability to relate to anyone my age/being down to earth). I have anxiety attacks every night before sleeping. I‚Äôm extremely restless and constantly degrade my self and body. I can‚Äôt stop remembering bullying from middle school and manipulative friends from high school. And I maladaptive day dream for hours on end. 

I have no one to talk to. No one. The few ‚Äúfriends‚Äù Ive made in the past 2 years at uni only want to communicate via Instagram , which I‚Äôve sworn off of for mental health reasons and because it‚Äôs a waste of my time. The only thing I have to focus on is school and getting a job, but it‚Äôs difficult because of the environment I‚Äôm in now (COVID made me move back in with parents and teen brother in tiny apartment in Toronto. No peace and quiet or regard for my privacy). 

I wish I was sure of myself. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted. But I‚Äôm the most insecure person I know. It‚Äôs stopping me from achieving so much. I‚Äôve lost out on so many opportunities. I‚Äôm smart, I know I am. I have great ideas, but I never voice them. 

The funny thing is, a lot of people think I‚Äôm super self aware and confident before they get to know how insecure and shy I really am. I wish I could just ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù, and I‚Äôve tried. Also the pandemic isn‚Äôt making it easy for me to practice my social skills.

1603723213,jifqev,Discussion,#FairDealNow4SSUO,"I write this as a support staff, as an alumni, and as a parent.

End this strike! The 1300+ support staff at uO have been through a lot in the last few years. We worked tirelessly to implement the new student information system (uoCampus). This required maximum effort and dedication from staff for years in preparation, implementation and stabilization of the new system. 2016 and 2017 were very difficult years, filled with gargantuan amounts of overtime hours, stress, and pressure. The support staff performed its duties with dedication and professionalism, ensuring a smooth transition for students and faculty alike.

In 2020, the 1300+ support staff ensured the continuation of the academic activities¬†required to keep the university not only afloat, but awash in surplus budgetary money: $36 million! While many other¬†businesses were having to temporarily suspend activities, or outright file for bankruptcy, the support staff kept the university in an enviable position.

We were thanked with proposed cuts to our health benefits, maternity leave benefits, wages, and pension allocations... A private hospital room will not make up for the thousands in out-of-pocket money the university is asking us to pony up. It is also worth mentioning that these cuts will target the most vulnerable of us, including women and parents with sick kids. We're not asking for any increases in our benefits, we just want to preserve what we currently. Cutting health benefits during a pandemic is flat our wrong. It's cruel.

Do the right thing uO, much like the support staff have been doing for all these years. Support your workers like we support our students and faculty. Get back to the bargaining table and cut a #FairDealNow4SSUO.

Sincerely,

Sometimes the best way to do something is to get rid of the old broken system and start over. 

Disbanding the union will give students a good opportunity to see if a union is actually needed, which I doubt by looking at the ‚Äúservices‚Äù they currently offer.

After successfully obtaining my diploma from said college, I transferred over to this university, in hopes that I could also obtain a degree. However, i am finding university a lot harder than college, and the fact that it‚Äôs all online doesn‚Äôt help either. 

I got my midterm marks for 2 of my courses, and keep in mind I am only taking 4 courses in total, and I got 4/30 on one, and 26/50 on another midterm. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I am considering dropping out while I am only one semester in, as that way I only have to pay off loans for one semester. 

I understand that university isn‚Äôt for everyone and I‚Äôm sure my diploma should be fine in finding a career that‚Äôll suit me. 

But I am also conflicted as I am sure a degree will benefit me in the future.

To sum it up, what would you do in my position? Are degrees really necessary? Should I be giving up so quickly? Is a diploma enough? If I were to stay , how could I improve my work ethic?
